How to set proxychains inkali linux.

1. log in as a root user
2. lets check if tor is installed/better install it again

   apt-get install tor

3. Then check for tor status if its started or not

   service tor status

4. start the tor service

    service tor start

5. then open the proxychains config file with nano

    nano /etc/proxychains.conf

6. uncheck or remove the pound symbol from Dynamic and insert the pound symbol in front of static and random .
also remove the pound symbol from "dns"

finally check or add the pound symbol from socks4
and enter 

socks5 (plus the ip address as same as socks4 and port number)

press control + o to save it and then press enter and then control + x to exit.

7. now try to run the command

    proxychains firefox 

8. once the firefox is opened , check for ip address or dns leaks by entering in the google search bar- it will show different country with different ip address.

9. if you get an error runnig the command "proxychains firefox"
then exit the root and then try running it again . it will work perfectly.

Thank you
